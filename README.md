# INSTAGRAM CLONE 
##### by Donnell Reuben
A replica of Instagram that allows users to sign up with a username, login with a username. Users can then post a photo and go through
different models of editing the photo, such as cropping, adding filters, and typing a description. Once the photo posts everyone who is
logged in can see the post and the user who posted it.
