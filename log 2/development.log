DEPRECATION WARNING: image/jpg is not a valid content type, it should not be used when creating a blob, and support for it will be removed in Rails 7.1. If you want to keep supporting this content type past Rails 7.1, add it to `config.active_storage.variable_content_types`. Dismiss this warning by setting `config.active_storage.silence_invalid_content_types_warning = true`. (called from <main> at /Users/chrisjeon/Projects/instagram-rails/db/seeds.rb:45)
